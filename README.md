# Project Name: *BibleVox*

Finally beginning the KJV translation ligature and Early Modern English processing (while also learning to use the Atom editor, environment and GIT/GITHUB integration). See the KVJ notes in the Synopsis below.

## Synopsis:

The BibleVox project provides a pronunciation lexicon of English language Bible words and proper names along with some enhancements to Bible Text-To-Speech (TTS) processing capabilities for use with the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) Festival speech engine. These products eventually will be ported also to the CMU Flite speech engine. The simple flat-file format and technology of the BibleVox pronunciation lexicon source data is intended to be easily translatable to other speech engines and technologies.

The author began the BibleVox project on May 1, 2016. The author is retired and devotes much of his spare time to this endeavor. The BibleVox pronunciation lexicon is very mature, especially for the ESV translation, with presently over 5650 entries (and growing), and includes most of the diverse spellings of proper names appearing in the various English language Bible translations. Proper name entries for the KJV translation have been completed. However, the CMU Festival speech engine presently is unable to process words containing ligatures (e.g. Cæsar and Judæa). Therefore, such words have been commented out of the BibleVox pronunciation lexicon until this issue is resolved. They are included within the BibleVox pronunciation lexicon source data for future use once ligature processing has been added. Entries for the KJV translation Early Modern English (e.g. thee, thou, thy, wilt, art, shalt) also must be completed.

Significant is the fact that the BibleVox project is a unique work available from this repository, under the stated terms, without cost or hitch. It is the BibleVox author's ambition to participate in the spreading of God's Word, during this time that He has alloted, before the return of His Son Jesus for His Church.
