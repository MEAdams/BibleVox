# Project Name: *BibleVox*

### Last updated: 05/13/2017

## Synopsis:

The BibleVox project provides a pronunciation lexicon of English language Bible words and proper names along with some enhancements to Bible Text-To-Speech (TTS) processing capabilities for the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) Festival speech engine. These products eventually will be ported also to the CMU Flite speech engine. The simple flat-file format and technology of the BibleVox pronunciation lexicon source data is intended to be easily translatable to other speech engines and technologies.

The author began the BibleVox project on May 1, 2016. The author is retired and has devoted all of his spare time to this endeavor. The BibleVox pronunciation lexicon is very mature, especially for the ESV translation, with presently over 5100 entries (and growing), and includes many of the diverse spellings of proper names appearing in the various English language Bible translations. Entries for other translations (in particular the KJV) are ongoing (i.e. WIP).

Significant is the fact that the BibleVox project is a unique work available from this repository, under the stated terms, without cost or hitch. It is the BibleVox author's ambition to participate in the spreading of God's Word, during this time that He has alloted, before the return of His Son Jesus for His Church.
