### Work In Progress:

Stay tuned and be patient. This repository is a work in process. The author began the BibleVox project on May 1, 2016 (i.e. almost 1 year ago at the time of this writing). The author is retired and has devoted all of his spare time to this endeavor. However, he is only now learning to use Git and GitHub (life would have been simpler...). The BibleVox lexicon is very mature, with presently a little over 5000 entries, and includes many of the diverse spellings of proper person/place names appearing in the various English language Bible translations. The ESV translation entries are among the most comprehensive and complete. Project documentation is under construction.

While recorded Bible audio formats do exist, they do not permit the precise indexing and text/word selection capabilities useful during study like the BibleVox project is able to support. It is the personal experience of the BibleVox author that his concentration and reading comprehension is increased when he is able to listen to God's Word while also reading it. Listening while reading also reinforces the learning of acceptable Bible proper name pronunciations. The BibleVox author hopes that this work in some form might also be able to provide aid to the visually impaired.
