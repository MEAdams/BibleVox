### Work In Progress:

Stay tuned and be patient. This repository is a work in process. The author began the BibleVox project on May 1, 2016 (i.e. almost 1 year ago at the time of this writing). The author is retired and has devoted all of his spare time to this endeavor. However, he is only now learning to use Git and GitHub (life would have been simpler...). The BibleVox lexicon is very mature, with presently over 5000 entries, and includes many of the diverse spellings of proper person/place names appearing in the various English language Bible translations. The ESV translation entries are among the most comprehensive and complete. Project documentation is under construction.
