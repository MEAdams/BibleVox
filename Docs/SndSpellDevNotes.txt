Notes & : 1. SndSpell is a spelling syntax in some ways similar to the other
Assumes :    re-spelling guides that have been devised over many years. This
        :    version is an attempt to simplify and regularize to facilitate
        :    ease of memorization and computer use. The other systems define
        :    multiple spellings for many sounds or sound combinations in
        :    order to provide varieties more suitable for visual recognition
        :    within particular word spellings and then stamp copyright notices
        :    on them. Such action makes no legal sense since all of these
        :    alternate systems are very similar (i.e. are not sufficiently
        :    unique). The SndSpell system is specifically reduced in size
        :    with an increase in logical spelling pattern regularity for
        :    ease in programming without significant compromise in visual
        :    word recognition (or so claimed). It is developed primarily as
        :    a means for scripting word pronunciations able to be easily
        :    translated into speech engine specific pronunciation lexicon
        :    syntax (e.g. Festival speech engine implementation of ArpaBet).
