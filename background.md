## Scope:

### Primary Purpose:
The primary purpose of the BibleVox project is for producing a pronunciation lexicon, in CMU dictionary format (i.e. Scheme code), of the proper names appearing in English language translations of the Bible. The lexicon also includes corrections for common words identified as being mispronounced by the stock release of Festival. In Festival parlance, the BibleVox lexicon is presently supplied as an "addenda" to the stock CMU pronunciation dictionary. However, certain entries within the stock CMU dictionary are able to take precedence over some common word corrections supplied by the BibleVox lexicon. Therefore, a few common English language words will continue to be incorrectly pronounced until a later stage of this project is completed that will permit the CMU dictionary itself to be updated with BibleVox lexicon entries. The BibleVox project also is producing a few modifications to the CMU Festival speech engine needed for improving its Bible text-to-speech (TTS) processing. It is intended to eventually port Festival speech engine processing improvements and the BibleVox lexicon to the CMU Flite speech engine as well.

It is the hope of the BibleVox author that this work might eventually become integrated into other open source Bible projects for the purpose of providing speech output for their users. While excellent recorded Bible audio formats do exist, they do not permit the precise indexing and text/word selection capabilities useful during study like the BibleVox project is able to support. It is the personal experience of the BibleVox author that his concentration and reading comprehension is increased when he is able to listen to God's Word while also reading it. Listening while reading also reinforces the learning of acceptable Bible proper name pronunciations. The BibleVox author hopes that this work might also provide aid to the visually impaired.


### Secondary Purpose:
The BibleVox project produces tools software to support the development and use of its BibleVox pronunciation lexicon. A secondary purpose of the BibleVox project is to make these tools and its documentation available to others.
