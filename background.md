### Background:

To date, the BibleVox project is releasing a pronunciation lexicon, in CMU dictionary format (i.e. Scheme code), of the proper names appearing in English language translations of the Bible. The lexicon also includes corrections for other common words being mispronounced by the stock release of Festival. In Festival parlance, the BibleVox lexicon is presently supplied as an "addenda" to the stock CMU pronunciation dictionary. However, certain entries within the stock CMU dictionary are able to take precedence over some common word corrections supplied by the BibleVox lexicon. Therefore, certain common English language words will continue to be incorrectly pronounced until a later stage of this project is completed that will permit the CMU dictionary itself to be updated with BibleVox lexicon entries.

The scope of this project will be expanded at a later date to include lexicon additions, the author's lexicon development tool software, the author's Festival speech engine enhancements, and BASH scripts for customizing and configuring the Festival speech engine. Much of this already exists, but has not yet been included in the Git repository do to lags in BibleVox documentation development. Support for the CMU Flite speech engine also is forthcoming.
